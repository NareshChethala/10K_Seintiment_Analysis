# Sentiment Analysis on SEC 10-K Filings
**Comparing Lexicon-Based and Transformer-Based Sentiment Analysis Techniques**

---

## üìÅ Project Overview

This project investigates the application of sentiment analysis methods to large-scale financial documents ‚Äî specifically, SEC 10-K annual filings.

We systematically compare:
- **Loughran-McDonald (LM) Lexicon-Based Approach** 
- **Transformer-Based FinBERT Model**

across full document text and major sections (Item 1: Risk Factors, Item 7: Management Discussion, Item 7A: Quantitative Disclosures).

Our goal is to evaluate how these two techniques perform on lengthy, domain-specific financial narratives, focusing on both **numerical scores** and **classification agreement**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods Used

- **Data Extraction**:  
  - SEC EDGAR crawler and BeautifulSoup parsing
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - HTML cleaning, whitespace removal, section parsing
- **Sentiment Analysis**:  
  - **LM Dictionary** for word-count-based sentiment scoring
  - **FinBERT Transformer** for deep contextualized sentiment scoring
- **Summarization (Optional Extension)**:  
  - BART-large-CNN model used to create summarized versions for experimental analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Pearson Correlation
  - Paired Samples t-Test
  - Agreement Rate Calculation
- **Visualization**:
  - Scatter Plots, Class Distribution Comparison, Agreement Rate Bar Charts
- **Tools**:  
  - Python, NLTK, Transformers (HuggingFace), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, LaTeX

## üìä Key Findings

- **Moderate positive correlation** between LM and FinBERT sentiment scores.
- **FinBERT generally assigns higher (less negative) sentiment** than LM.
- **Significant differences** in sentiment detection especially for risk-related sections (Item 1 and Item 7A).
- **Agreement rates** between methods range between **61\%‚Äì68\%** across sections.
- **LM tends toward neutral labeling**, whereas FinBERT identifies more positive tone in financial narratives.
